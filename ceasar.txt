# A sililoquy of Marc Anthony

O pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers
Thou art the ruin of the noblest man
Who ever liv'd in the tide of times
Woe to the hands that shed this costly blood
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy 

A curse shall light upon the limbs of men
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
Shall cumber all the parts if Italy
Blood and destruction shall  be so in use
Ad dreadful objects so familiar
That mothers shall but smile when they behold
Their infants quarter'd by the hands of war
